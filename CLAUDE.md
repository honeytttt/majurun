# MajuRun — Claude Code Instructions

## Critical Behaviors — Do Not Regress

### Audio Session / Voice Coaching (voice_controller.dart)
**NEVER use `AudioSessionConfiguration.speech()` anywhere in this codebase.**
- `.speech()` uses exclusive audio focus (`gainFull`) → STOPS Spotify and other music apps entirely
- The correct config is `gainTransientMayDuck` + `duckOthers` — this lowers music volume during TTS then restores it
- `configure()` must be called **once** inside `_initTts()` — calling it inside `_speak()` resets audio focus on every announcement and causes interruptions
- After TTS completes, `setActive(false)` must be called via `_tts.setCompletionHandler(...)` to release audio focus and restore music volume

**Protected pattern (never change this):**
```dart
// _initTts() — called once:
await session.configure(const AudioSessionConfiguration(
  avAudioSessionCategory: AVAudioSessionCategory.playback,
  avAudioSessionCategoryOptions: AVAudioSessionCategoryOptions.duckOthers,
  avAudioSessionMode: AVAudioSessionMode.spokenAudio,
  androidAudioAttributes: AndroidAudioAttributes(
    contentType: AndroidAudioContentType.speech,
    usage: AndroidAudioUsage.assistanceNavigationGuidance,
  ),
  androidAudioFocusGainType: AndroidAudioFocusGainType.gainTransientMayDuck,
  androidWillPauseWhenDucked: false,
));
_tts.setCompletionHandler(() async {
  final s = await AudioSession.instance;
  await s.setActive(false);
});

// _speak() — only activates, no configure():
await session.setActive(true);
```

### TestFlight / Build Numbers
- `pubspec.yaml` build number (after `+`) must **always exceed** the last uploaded App Store Connect build
- Last known upload: build 130 (version 1.0.0+130)
- Always increment build number before pushing a release branch
- Do not use `continue-on-error: true` on App Store Connect upload CI step — it silently hides rejection errors

---

### Run Stop Button (active_run_screen.dart)
- Stop run is a **simple tap** — no hold-to-stop, no long press, no animation
- `_handleStopRun()` already shows a confirmation dialog; just call it from `onTap`
- Do not re-introduce `_HoldToEndButton` or any `AnimationController`-based stop mechanism

---

## Architecture Notes

- **Audio**: `flutter_tts` + `audio_session` package. Android uses `AndroidAudioFocusGainType`, iOS uses `AVAudioSessionCategoryOptions`
- **Auth**: Firebase Auth + Google Sign-In. SHA-1 (debug + release) + Play Store signing SHA must all be registered in Firebase console
- **Notifications**: `permission_handler` + `flutter_local_notifications`. iOS uses `openAppSettings()`, Android uses two-button flow (battery optimization + exact alarms)
- **Firestore rules**: changes require `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` — pushing code does NOT deploy rules
- **Leaderboard**: `LeaderboardService` returns real Firestore data only — no sample/fake padding data

## Prompting Tips (for the user)

To get the best results and avoid regression loops:

1. **Start each session with**: "Don't change X — it's working" for any behavior you want protected
2. **Reference CLAUDE.md**: Say "check CLAUDE.md before touching audio" — Claude reads it automatically
3. **Before committing new features**, ask: "Verify that voice ducking still uses gainTransientMayDuck and configure() is only in _initTts()"
4. **When reporting a bug**, include what was working before: "Voice ducking worked in build 121, broke in 124 — what changed?"
5. **Use git log context**: Claude reads recent commits — good commit messages (like `fix: stop Spotify pause`) help future sessions understand history
